<b>Diary</b> allows you to enter notes against past, present and future dates to record
information you feel is related to the relevant transaction.
eg. You may want to note a future change where the transaction amount changes on a certain date.

The records may be searched.

<b>Future</b> transactions will flag up before they are due to allow you to make the necessary changes.

You can also click the <b>Next 14 days Diary</b> button which will show you all Diary
entries for the next 14 days.
The <b>Diary</b> may be backed up, and restored if required.

<h2 id="release">Release Notes</h2><p><a href="#top">Return to index</a></p>
<pre class="oview">
<b>Release Notes</b> highlight functionality changes to the app.

<b>Version 1.01</b>released 17th January 2026.
Full app functionality released, including built in PWA - Progressive web app.

<b>*</b>Progressive Web App (PWA) on an iPad is essentially a website that has been designed to look and feel like a regular native app. It bridges the gap between a standard website and a dedicated app you would download from the App Store.  
Instead of downloading it through the store, you install it directly from Safari. Once added to your Home Screen, it loses the browser interface (the URL bar and tabs) and runs in its own window, just like any other app

<p><a href="#top">Return to index</a></p>
<h2 id="whatif">Whatif</h2><p><a href="#top">Return to index</a></p>
<pre class="oview">
You can have a <b>What if </b>scenario and use the 24 Month Projection table to see
the effect of adding either an expense or income.

The most likely scenario would be adding an expense to see what the effect is on your
future balances.

<b>For example</b>
You want to see the effect of saving <b>£100</b> per month for <b>Holidays</b>
Add a transaction, enter <b>Holiday Savings</b> against the Description, enter <b>£100</b> 
for the amount, select a date and Category for it and <b>Add Transaction</b>

The 24 month projection is immediately updated.
You can either scroll down the table to see the effect, or a quicker way is to look at
<b>Negative balances</b> or <b>Salary -1 balances</b>

Once you see the effect you can keep the transaction, or if the expense is too much
either delete it or reduce the amount, depending on your circumstances or preference.

🗓️ The "Day-Before-Payday" Metric
The most critical number in any budget isn't your current balance -
it’s your minimum balance.
• What it does: The app automatically calculates and populates
   a "trough" balance for the day before your next income arrives.
• The Benefit: It tells you exactly how much "unallocated" cash 
    you have, ensuring you never accidentally spend money that 
    is already spoken for by upcoming bills.

🖖 The "Nudge" System (Real-Time Reconciliation)
Banking isn't a 24/7 reality, even in 2026. Weekends and Bank Holidays 
shift when money actually moves.
• What it does: A dedicated "Nudge" button allows you to shift future
   transactions forward by 2–3 days with a single click.
• The Benefit: This aligns your projection table perfectly with your 
   bank's "cleared" balance, eliminating the confusion of "Weekend Lag."

📒 Future-Proof Diary & Alerts
Anticipate "Price Creep" before it hits your wallet.
• What it does: The Diary system allows you to flag future price
   increases or one-off changes to recurring subscriptions.
• The Benefit: With built-in alerts, you get a "decision window" to cancel 
   or switch services before the increased cost impacts your projection.

🧪 "What-If" Stress Testing
Test your financial resilience without touching your real data.
• What it does: Easily inject temporary expenses or income changes 
   to see how they ripple through your future balances.
• The Benefit: See instantly if an unexpected £100 expense today creates 
   a "negative balance popup" up to 24 months from now.

🔒 Privacy-First / Zero-Cloud
Your financial life belongs to you, not a server.
• Architecture: Built using Web Local Storage, meaning 100%
   of your data stays in your browser.
• Portability: Use the JSON Export/Import to move your setup 
   between devices or keep encrypted backups, ensuring you 
   are never locked into a proprietary platform.

🎈The App, relies on data from 3 sources to work;
	A start date (usually the current date)
	An opening balance (your bank balance on the start date)
	A list of your monthly and 4-weekly transactions (if you have any)
From these, it can be built in less than a minute.

<h2 id="setup">How to set up manually</h2><p><a href="#top">Return to index</a></p>
<pre class="oview">
First, enter a start date by clicking into <b>Start date</b> field and selecting a date from the date picker.
Next, enter the <b>Opening Balance</b> of your bank account on that date, then click <b>Save.</b>
<b>Note!</b>if your bank balance on the start date is (eg) £150, and you have transactions 
on the same date, add the transactions to your bank balance and this should be your opening
balance. eg. if your transactions are £50, bank balance £150, opening balance should be <b>£200</b>


You should now add your <b>Categories</b>. eg. Household, Insurance, Savings etc. Enter your first Category in 
the box above Transaction table, then click <b>Add Category</b>. Add as many Categories as you need, 
you can add more as required. 
Now start adding your transactions by adding a calendar month's worth to ensure you 
have all your data entered.

Enter the <b>Description</b>, next the <b>Amount</b>, then select whether the 
transaction is <b>Expense</b> or <b>Income</b>. 

The next field allows to select the transaction <i>Period</i>
normally either <b>Monthly</b> or, if it's relevant <b>4-Weekly</b>. 
You can select <b>Irregular</b> for one off transactions. 

The next field allows you to select the <b>Date</b> for the transaction - either the date for 
<b>Monthly</b> transactions, or the <i>first</i> date <b>after</b> the <b>Start date</b> of a <b>4-weekly transaction</b>
Next select the appropriate <b>Category</b> for the transaction. 

Finally, click <b>Add Transaction</b>.
The transaction will appear in the table below. 
Add as many transactions as you require.

As you add transactions, they will appear in the <b>24 Month Transaction</b>table.

<b>Note!</b>
<i>On first use, you should enter, starting from your <b> Start date</b> all of your <b>Monthly</b> transactions 
for one calendar month. If you have <b>4-Weekly transactions</b> add the next date after the start date they 
are due and ensure you enter all of this type.

The system will calculate the transactions and populate the <b>24 Month Projection</b> table.

If you do have <b>4-Weekly</b> transactions, once the date you enter initially has passed, the system will 
alter the day of the month shown in the <b>transaction</b> table by adding 28 days to ensure 
these <i>days</i> are always accurate</i>

<h2 id="howdata">How Data is stored</h2><p><a href="#top">Return to index</a></p>
<pre class="oview">
When you enter a <b>start date</b> and <b>opening balance</b> then either load transactions
manually or via CSV loader, or via Import transactions JSOB, the data is stored using <b>local storage</b>.
<b>local storage</b> is a type of web storage that allows a website or web application to 
store data directly in the user's browser. It acts like a small, private filing cabinet for 
that specific website on your computer or tablet.

• Persistent: Unlike Session storage (which disappears when you close the tab), data in local storage 
stays there even if you close the browser or restart your device.  
• Domain-Specific: Data saved by website-a.com cannot be read by website-b.com. 
This ensures privacy and security between different apps.
• It is also browser specific.
• No Expiration: The data remains until the web app deletes it or you manually 
clear your browser's cache/cookies
• <b>Note!</b> If you do clear the browser cache for any reason, you can easily re-build
you app by entering a relevant start date and opening balance and importing your transactions
using CSV import - this takes less than a minute to do.

<h2 id="csv">How to import transactions via CSV</h2><p><a href="#top">Return to index</a></p>
<pre class="oview">
Building the system (app) using <b>Import transactions (csv)</b> is the quickest method of creating
transactions so that the <b>24 Month Projection</b> can be populated.
It relies on you creating a spreadsheet containing a row for each transaction. The spreadsheet
should then be saved as a <b>CSV</b> file to a location on your Computer or Tablet that is readily
accessible for any subsequent re-loads.
The format of the spreadsheet is strict and <b>must</b> adhere to the following specification;

The data should be in the format;
Column A:Header text=<b>Date</b>, content - standard date format
Column B:Header text=<b>Amount</b>, content - numeric
Column C:Header text=<b>Income/Expense</b>, content - either the text <b>income</b> or <b>expense</b>
Column D:Header text=<b>Category </b>, content - Text containing your chosen category
Column E:Header text=<b>Description </b>, content - Text containing a description of the transaction.
Column F:Header text=<b>Frequency </b>, content - either the text <b>Monthly</b> or <b>4-Weekly</b>
<b>Note!</b> 
The header row is case sensitive and <b>must</b> be as shown.
The Income/Expense data is also case sensitive, lower case.
The frequency is case sensitive and <b>must</b> be as shown.

On the first build of the system, enter start date and opening balance, then click on 
<b>choose file</b> next to <b>Import transactions CSV </b> then click <b>Import (replace existing)</b>
The transactions will instantly load. If there are any errors and alert will inform you.
Simply scroll to see all your transactions.

<b>An example of loading data</b>
If you have a start date of 12th Jan 2026 with an opening balance of <b>£x.yz</b>
your spreadsheet should have, as it's initial transaction, one dated 12th Jan 2026 (if you have one then)
<b>OR</b> one for the <b>NEXT</b> date after that. Then add your transactions in date order from then till
<b>11th Feb 2026</b>. This gives you one month's worth of transactions to load into the app.
