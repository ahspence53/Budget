🗓️ The "Day-Before-Payday" Metric
The most critical number in any budget isn't your current balance -
it’s your minimum balance.
• What it does: The app automatically calculates and populates
   a "trough" balance for the day before your next income arrives.
• The Benefit: It tells you exactly how much "unallocated" cash 
    you have, ensuring you never accidentally spend money that 
    is already spoken for by upcoming bills.

🖖 The "Nudge" System (Real-Time Reconciliation)
Banking isn't a 24/7 reality, even in 2026. Weekends and Bank Holidays 
shift when money actually moves.
• What it does: A dedicated "Nudge" button allows you to shift future
   transactions forward by 2–3 days with a single click.
• The Benefit: This aligns your projection table perfectly with your 
   bank's "cleared" balance, eliminating the confusion of "Weekend Lag."

📒 Future-Proof Diary & Alerts
Anticipate "Price Creep" before it hits your wallet.
• What it does: The Diary system allows you to flag future price
   increases or one-off changes to recurring subscriptions.
• The Benefit: With built-in alerts, you get a "decision window" to cancel 
   or switch services before the increased cost impacts your projection.

🧪 "What-If" Stress Testing
Test your financial resilience without touching your real data.
• What it does: Easily inject temporary expenses or income changes 
   to see how they ripple through your future balances.
• The Benefit: See instantly if an unexpected £100 expense today creates 
   a "negative balance popup" up to 24 months from now.

🔒 Privacy-First / Zero-Cloud
Your financial life belongs to you, not a server.
• Architecture: Built using Web Local Storage, meaning 100%
   of your data stays in your browser.
• Portability: Use the JSON Export/Import to move your setup 
   between devices or keep encrypted backups, ensuring you 
   are never locked into a proprietary platform.

🎈The App, relies on data from 3 sources to work;
	A start date (usually the current date)
	An opening balance (your bank balance on the start date)
	A list of your monthly and 4-weekly transactions (if you have any)
From these, it can be built in less than a minute.
